2) How to attribute ? " 2D UI pack courtesy of Soloflare Designs Ltd http://soloflare.blogspot.com . CC BY 3.0. "

3) Why isn't this on an asset store ? I honestly don't know. Haven't gotten around to doing that.

4) What's up with the file naming? ? I don't know. I did put everything in separate folders to make it extremely easy for you though. This means you can rename, copy and paste it over the local folder of the asset you intend to replace. You could even use a batch renamer if you wish. 

5) Do you provide customer support for the free asset pack ? No.
